Yes, I am familiar with the anime Spy x Family. It is a 2022 anime adaptation of the manga series of the same name by Tatsuya Endo. The story follows a spy named Twilight who must "build a family" to execute a mission, not realizing that the girl he adopts as his daughter is a telepath, and the woman he agrees to be in a marriage with is a skilled assassin.

The anime has been praised for its humor, heartwarming moments, and well-developed characters. It has also been a commercial success, becoming one of the most popular anime series of 2022.

I am particularly fond of the relationship between the three main characters, Twilight, Yor, and Anya. They are all flawed individuals, but they come together to form a loving and supportive family. I also enjoy the show's humor, which is often subtle and understated.

Overall, I think Spy x Family is a great anime that is sure to appeal to a wide range of viewers. It is funny, heartwarming, and suspenseful, with well-developed characters and a unique premise. I highly recommend it.
